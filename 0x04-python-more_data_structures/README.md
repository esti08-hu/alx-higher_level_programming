0x04. Python - More Data Structures: Set, Dictionary

This is a list of Python and C programs with explanations:

0. Search and replace: 1-search_replace.py is a Python function that replaces all occurrences of an element with another in a new list.
my_list: initial list
search: element to replace

1. replace: new element
Unique addition: 2-uniq_add.py is a Python function that adds all unique integers in a list.
No modules are imported.

2. Present in both: 3-common_elements.py is a Python function that returns a set of common elements in two sets.
No modules are imported.

3. Only differents: 4-only_diff_elements.py is a Python function that returns a set of all elements present in only one set.
No modules are imported.

4. Number of keys: 5-number_keys.py is a Python function that returns the number of keys in a dictionary.
No modules are imported.

5. Print sorted dictionary: 6-print_sorted_dictionary.py is a Python function that prints a dictionary by ordered keys.
The function assumes all keys are strings.
Keys are printed in alphabetic order.
Keys are only sorted on the first level.
Dictionary values can have any type.
No modules are imported.

6. Update dictionary: 7-update_dictionary.py is a Python function that replaces or adds key/value pairs in a dictionary.
The parameter key is always a string.
The parameter value is any type.
If a key exists in the dictionary, the value is replaced.
If a key does not exist in the dictionary, it is created.
No modules are imported.

7. Simple delete by key: 8-simple_delete.py is a Python function that deletes a key in a dictionary.
The parameter key is always a string.
If the key does not exist, the dictionary does not change.
No modules are imported.

8. Multiply by 2: 9-multiply_by_2.py is a Python function that returns a new dictionary with all values multiplied by 2.
The function assumes all values are integers.
No modules are imported.

9. Best score: 10-best_score.py is a Python function that returns a key value with the biggest integer value.
The function assumes all values are integers.
The function assumes all students have a different score.
If no score is found, the function returns None.
No modules are imported.

10. Multiply by using map: 11-multiply_list_map.py is a Python function that returns a list with all values multiplied by a number using map.
Returns a new list of the same length as my_list with each value multiplied by number.
The initial list is not modified.
No loops or importing modules are used.

11. Roman to Integer: 12-roman_to_int.py is a Python function that converts a roman numeral to an integer.
The function assumes the number will be between 1-3999.
If the parameter roman_string is not a string or None, the function returns 0.

12. Weighted average!: 100-weight_average.py is a Python function that returns the weighted average of all integers in a list of tuples.
Tuple format: (<score>, <weight>).
If the list is empty - returns 0.
No modules are imported.

13. Squared by using map: 101-square_matrix_map.py is a Python function that computes the square value of all integers of a matrix using map.
The parameter matrix is a two-dimensional array.
Returns a new matrix of the same size as matrix with each value squared.
The initial matrix is not modified.
No loops or importing modules are used.

14. Delete by value: 102-complex_delete.py is a Python function that deletes keys with a specific value in a dictionary.
If the value does not exist, the dictionary is not changed.
All keys having the searched value are deleted.
No modules are imported.

15. CPython #1: PyBytesObject: 103-python.c are C functions that print basic information about Python lists and Python bytes objects.
